## Again ?

I have **_once again_** re-written my personal website using new technologies. It has become _(sort-of)_ an annual ritual for me, I guess. From starting out with **Astro**, transitioning to **Next.js** and finally settling down with the _least hated_ javascript framework right now, **Svelte**.

## Tech-Stack

The stack used is pretty simple, **SvelteKit** for the application, **git** for versioning and **fly.io** for deployment. I wanted a framework that is as close to the native web as possible, while also keeping the options to incrementally add interactive experiences as and when required. Hence, _svelte_ was the first choice for me.

While I have a soft spot for **Next.js**, it's just that the caching behaviour is something that I really didn't appreciate, so I didn't use it. I am pretty happy with my choice of using _svelte_.

## The Future

Eventually, this website will blossom into a customized, personal and extensive collection of digital services **_(articles, video courses, member area, etc.)_**, but that is all in the future.

For now, this will be the home for my thoughts.
